MeanArealStats.IMF - Mean areal rainfall [mm h^-1], {Nx1 vector}.
MeanArealStats.WAR - Wet area ratio [-], {Nx1 vector}.
MeanArealStats.CAR - cloud area ratio [-], {Nx1 vector}.
MeanArealStats.Time - Time [Matlab format], {Nx1 vector}.
MeanArealStats.U500 - u wind component 500hPa [m s^-1], {Nx1 vector}.
MeanArealStats.V500 - v wind component 500hPa [m s^-1], {Nx1 vector}.

N - Sample size.

For Engelberger catchment- IMF, WAR and Time data were derived from the MeteoSwiss weather radar system using a 2-km grid and a domain size of 26 km x 26 km for the period 2003-2010.
Each time step is 5-min. CAR data was derived from the Merra reanalysis products, 0.5 deg x 0.66 deg and 1-h in time, linear interpolated to 5-min time steps.
U and V components also derived from the Merra reanalysis,1 h resolution interpolated to 5 min intervals.
