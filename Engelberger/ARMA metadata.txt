ARMA.mat
---
ARMA.ar - Autoregressive components for the Largrangian field [-], {N, empty scalar for zero}.
ARMA.ma - Moving average components for the Largrangian field [-], {N, empty scalar for zero}.

N - number of components

For Engelberger catchment- ARMA was calculated using the MeteoSwiss weather radar system (2-km grid) for a domain size of 26 km x 26 km for the period 2003-2010.
An example Matlab script for estimating the ARMA products is given in "ARMA_estimate.m" file and an example to a storm is saved in ARMA_Storm_example.mat

To execute: 
load('ARMA_Storm_example.mat')
ARMA=ARMA_estimate(R);
